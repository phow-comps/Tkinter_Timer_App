# Tkinter_Timer_App

Fourth Competition:

☘️ Make a Timer Application using Tkinter. You can use any other modules you like, and make is as unique and detailed as possible. 

☘️ This time, the grading is a bit different... you will be graded based on your design, colour schemes, and overall feel of the app instead of just your coding ability. An example of the timer app is attached below. The attached timer is very basic, and we definitely expect something more advanced from you guys. You can also not hear the sound since it is a screen recording, but the timer made an audible beeping sound once it reached 0.

☘️ To submit your code, head over to #deleted-channel and click on the Submit Competition Code button. A new channel named: TICKET-your_name will pop up for you, under the OTHER  category. Head over to that channel and attach your code/any other relevant attachments there.
